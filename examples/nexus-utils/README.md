# Example - Delete Files from Sonatype Nexus

This small program is an example for using `inoks-rest-utils`.

Used it for myself to clean up old snapshots in my nexus repository.

Just checkout the repository and adjust the class `NexusUtilsApplication`.

Bootstrap the project via the gradlew wrapper.

## Prerequisites
* Java 11 or higher.
